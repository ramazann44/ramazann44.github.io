            I first started the software with my high school education.
            I studied advanced PHP and C# from scratch in my high school education. 
            When i come to college my education continued with C++ and C#. 
            Since I don't want my software knowledge to be low, 
            I learned how to make a website with Asp.Net with my own efforts and lessons. 
            I learned how to build applications with Java and create Android applications. 
            Both Android and Ios with React Native course I learned application development. 
            After I have fully developed myself in these languages I know, 
            my goal is to learn how to develop 2D and 3D games using C# and Unity.
